# Queueing Systems

We implement for now the **M/G/1 model**

## M/G/1 model

We assume the service time to follow a Uniform distribution between `theta1` and `theta2` and the inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed
with rate `theta3` (the code can be easily generalized to other cases). The output of the model is a vector representing the inter-departure times after the queue starts from empty.

We'll use [Lindley equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindley_equation) to simulate it; that allows to easily obtain the customerâ€™s waiting and service times, from which the inter-departure times are obtained easily.
