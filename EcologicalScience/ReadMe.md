# Ecological Science

We give here some models from ecological science.

- [Ricker model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricker_model) is a discrete population model; we use the version described in [1] which adds some stochastic noise
- [Lotka-Volterra model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations) is the standard prey-predator dynamic model, defined in terms of a coupled ODE; we implement the version described in Appendix T.10 in [2], where the ODE is integrated and observations are made at 10 evenly-spaced time points inside the integration interval with a lognormal noise. Both the number of preys and predators are observed, with an (optional) lognormal noise. We also implement a logpdf calculation, which assumes lognormal observation noise. 
- EarthWorms models:  for now, we wrapped with ABCpy two of the five different models used in the paper [3]; these require using NetLogo (see [here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)). Please check in the folder for more details.
