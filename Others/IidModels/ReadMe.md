# Univariate iid models

We give here the following univariate models: 

- [beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution)
- [gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution) (shape and scale parametrization)
- [gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)

Each model generates iid samples from the above one. The parametrization used are the standard one described in the Wikipedia pages (links above). 

We also give the exact sufficient statistics for these models (in `Statistics.py`).
