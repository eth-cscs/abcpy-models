# ABCpy Models

This repository contains a number of different models implemented in ABCpy, broadly classified following different scientific areas:

# Scientific areas:
--------------------------------
* [BiologicalScience](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models/tree/master/BiologicalScience): This folder contains the models from biological science (e.g., [Platelets deposition-aggregession model](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models/tree/master/BiologicalScience/PlateletsDeposition)))
* [EcologicalScience](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models/tree/master/EcologicalScience): This folder contains some ODE models from ecological science (e.g., Ricker and Lotka-Volterra models); see in the folder for more details
* [Climate](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models/tree/master/Climate): This folder contains the models from climate science (e.g., [Lorenz 95 model of weather prediction](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models/tree/master/Climate/Lorenz95Stochastic))
* [MolecularDynamics](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models/tree/master/MolecularDynamics): This folder contains the models from Molecular Dynamics (e.g., [TIP4P force-field of water](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models/tree/master/MolecularDynamics/WaterTIP4P) and [LJ potential of helium](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models/tree/master/MolecularDynamics/HeliumLJ))
* [Network](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models/tree/master/Network): This folder contains models from Network science (e.g., [Various spreading processes on networks](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models/tree/master/Network/SpreadingProcessNetwork) or [mehcanistic models of network generation](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models/tree/master/Network/NetworkGeneration))
* [TransportDynamics](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models/tree/master/TransportDynamics) This folder contains models for Transport Dynamics (e.g., [Floor field of pedestrians' walking through corner](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models/tree/master/TransportDynamics/PedestrianWalkingCorner))
* [QueueingSystems](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models/tree/master/QueueingSystems) This folder contains the M/G/1 queueing model which is used frequently for benchmarking ABC algorithms (see README in that folder for more information)
* Other: Some other models (e.g., multivariate g-and-k model, timeseries and iid models for which the likelihood is known)

These official models are a collection of example models that use ABCpy's high-level APIs. They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with the latest stable ABCpy API. We especially recommend newer ABCpy users to start [here](http://abcpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html#getting-started).
